## Tests
  
upoin the addition of each new functional piece of this program, i ran multiple tests in termila to see how the program would behave. First I made sure inquirer was working using a simple inquirer prompt, then I put in all the prompts I thought I would need, then I tested to see if the program would insert the prompt responses into the text of a readMe template, last i tested to ensure that all licensing options properly generated the correct corresponding badge.
